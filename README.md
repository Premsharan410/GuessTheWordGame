Each category leads to a separate game screen (`index1.html`, `index2.html`, etc.) with its own word list and styling.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Choose a category from the home screen.  
2. A random word from that category is selected.  
3. Guess letters one by one.  
4. Incorrect guess shows a popup.
5. Win by revealing all letters correctly!
